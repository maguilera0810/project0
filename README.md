    -Two css files and 1 scss file

There is an unordered list on each file except by index.html which can be found from line 14 to 31. In addition, a table can also be found at after the body tag on the same file. 

Referring to the stylesheet files, "styles2.css" has been created all by myself with sass and it contains a mobile responsive @media query change for smaller screens, when the user reduce the screen width below 500px, the image background color change.
There can also be observed that there are five different css 
properties & selector between "style3.css" and "style2.css".

The bootstrap component used in this project is found on each file
inside the unordered list, the grid(at final of index.html) and tables on each file.

Finally, at the beginig of "style2.scss" we will find some vairables
on the file, nesting property  appears on line 34 to 36 of
the same file and the inheritance property can be found on line 31 and 22.
