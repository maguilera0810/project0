# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


This project presents information related to 
four different movies which have been produced
by Studio Ghibli. It has been designed with
the following structure:

    -Five html files: index.html, movingcastle.html,
        ponyo.html, spiritedaway.html & totoro.html
    
    Note: You can navigate to each one of the  html 
    pages from every page.

    -Two css files and 1 scss file

    -A total of 10 images
    

There is an unordered list which can be found 
on index.html from line 16 to 21. In addition, a table
can also be found after the unordered list on the same 
file. 

Referring to the sheet files, "styles.css" has been
created all by myself and it contains  amobile responsive 
@media query change for smaller screens, when the user clicks
on any movie, if the screen width is below 500px, the background
will change in terms of color. There can also be observed
that there are  five different css properties & selectors.

The bootstrap component used in this project is found on
index.html  inside the unordered list (the buttons), and the two
columns for layout using grid were used with a set of images
obtained from the movies  on line 61 to 82.

Finally, on "style1.scss" we will find  the variable used on the
line 6 of the file, nesting property  appears on line 9 to 21 of
the same file and the inheritance property can be found on line 28
to 32, where the properties of class "letra" are being added to class "titulo"
